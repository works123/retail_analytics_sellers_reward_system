# #Retail Analytics: Sellers' Management System
Sellers' Reward System Management Dashboard and Performance Prediction System for an Ecommerce Marketplace Company

## Brief
<strong>Zimla</strong> is an ecommerce company that offers a marketplace for sellers and buyers.  Sellers sell their products online, while buyers(customers) make purchases and have their orders delivered to them. Being a marketplace, to remain profitable, <strong>Zimla</strong> requires that its sellers are top notch and consistently exceed customers expectation. In recent months, its  call center has  been receiving customers complains around the delivery of their orders. 

The CEO would like a comprehensive approach to addressing this challenge hence has recommended that a Sellers' Reward System Management dashboard, through which sellers can in real time be effectively managed and monitored. He expects that this significantly improve customers' reviews and result in increased revenue this  year.

You are part of a data science consulting startup that  has been  asked to do a POC to <strong>Zimla's</strong> management team. The outcome of this would determine if your organization would be contracted to implement  the solution for <strong>Zimla</strong>. 

However, their is a little glitch though <strong>Zimla</strong> has  requested that your startup show case your offering, the CEO would not release its company data, he is sceptical. He thinks data science is all media hype and consulting companies' gimmicks.

Your lead consultant rather than reject this proposal, is determined to make a case for data science.  Through research and consultation with  <strong>Zimla's</strong>  management, he discovered that [Olist Store](https://olist.com/) a similar ecommerce company in Brazil  has made public its ecommerce data from 2016 to 2018 on  100k orders.  With <strong>Zimla's</strong>  permission he would require you and other team members to develop the POC.

> Hello Team,
> 
> We have an opportunity to bring our company's offerings to the retail space. Using the Olist dataset we are to develop a Sellers' Reward System Management Dashboard and Performance Prediction System that would help <strong>Zimla's</strong>  answer the following questions and better serve their customers:
>
> - Who are the sellers we have and what product are they selling?
> - How many orders are each sellers getting weekly, monthly and yearly?
> - How are the sellers doing with meeting their delivery(logistics) commitment to the customers?
> - How are the sellers performing in terms of product review?
> - Where are the sellers located?  Geolocation data has been provided.
>   - Where do we have densely populated sellers and where do have very little sellers to meet orders?
> - How does sellers location affect delivery services?
> - Can you discover any seasonlity in our products or ordering pattern 
> - Determine if there is a relationship between customer satisfaction and product type
> - Determine if there are sellers who consistently get good review and those who do not
> - Determine top performing and least performing sellers by order and sales value
> - Can you detemine what factors make a seller a top performer and least performer
>
> I have reviewed the dataset and I strongly believe beyond answering the above questions  for <strong>Zimla</strong>, there are other offerings and product we can propose to the management while making our pitch for this job.  Please I look forward to us including these in our product pitch to them.  

> I know we can do this. Gentlemen & ladies, it's time to roll up our sleeves.

> Your Lead,

### Tools and Technologies
- PowerBI
- Python
- SQL
- Datatabase System 
- Time Series Methodology

### Tasks
- Create a PowerBI dashboard 
. Create a database system  for the dashboard
- using time series methods predict  order level for each seller for 
  - the next day
  - the next 7-days 
- Using machine Learning  predict the order level and order value per seller for 
  - the next day
  - the next 7-days 
- Embed your machine learning model in the PowerBI dashboard

### Deliverables
- Dynamic dashboard - Dashboard where a user can interact with the data.
- Power Point presentation to Zimla management
  - your slide should contain a recommendation on what reward system can be used to improve sellers' performance
- A local database system
- Jupyter Notebook containing model implementation

### Additional Tasks (compulsory for Data/ML Engineers but optional for Data Scientists)

- Deploy your database system in a Cloud infrasture
- Deploy your machine learning model as an API in the Cloud
- Test your API using Postman.



### Additional Deliverables (compulsory for Data/ML engineers but optional for data scientists)
- Design a system (be as detailed as possible - you do not need to implement this) that would ensure your solution remain up-to-date with sellers daily records.
  - include you design in your presentation 
  - recommend the infrastructure <strong>Zimla's</strong>  should consider investing in to achieve this.
